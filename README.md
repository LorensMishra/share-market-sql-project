## 🧪 Sample SQL Queries

```sql
-- Total portfolio value per trader
SELECT tr.trader_id, tr.first_name, tr.last_name,
       SUM(p.quantity_held * s.price_per_share) AS portfolio_value
FROM Portfolio p
JOIN Traders tr ON p.trader_id = tr.trader_id
JOIN Stocks s ON p.stock_id = s.stock_id
GROUP BY tr.trader_id, tr.first_name, tr.last_name;
```

```sql
-- Total shares sold per company
SELECT c.company_name, SUM(t.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM Transactions t
JOIN Stocks s ON t.stock_id = s.stock_id
JOIN Companies c ON s.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE t.transaction_type = 'SELL'
GROUP BY c.company_name;
```
